# Connectus Global Full Stack (React) Engineering Exercise 2020 Q1

### Hello from Connectus Global!

We're excited to share this take-home exercise with you. We look forward to discussing your solution soon and hope you find this interesting along the way. We know time can be tight for projects like this. Thank you for making time to work on it. On to the challenge!

## Overview

At Connectus Global we think [React](https://reactjs.org/) is pretty great. It played a huge role for us and is the frontend framework of choice, and obviously the one we use for one of our flagship applications. If you haven't used React before (we believe almost all candidates receiving this exercise have at least some exposure), it is conceptually very similar to Angular or Vue. If you've used either, we think you'll feel comfortable with the setup here. Using the base application provided and a combination of provided code and code you write, we'll build a simple single page application (spa) that exhibits the features, power dn flexibility of react.

## What are we building?

The application is a single page application, bootstraped with the create-react-app. At completion, we'll have an application with one (1) component that can accept input and fetch remote data, the below list can be used for the functionality we are looking for:
